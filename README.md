# simple educational games for kids
The project is WIP. I only got a couple of *hours* in the next month. Will see how far I can push this...

## Aim
Simple HTML/JS educational games for children

## Boundaries
- Code should be as simple as possible so it's easy for everyone to extend
- Must run offline (e.g. by simply copying to a smartphone, tablet, raspberry pi, laptop, ...)

## Planned Games
### Memory
Memory Game with:
- Letters
- Numbers
- Animals -> Just starting with this one based on https://github.com/code-sketch/memory-game/blob/master/video-11/index.html. 

# Open
Should one use a web framework? Hmmm....
